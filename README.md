### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍💻 I have always been curious about technology, so I decided to go for a professional change. I spent some time training in programming in a self-taught way and for family reasons I could not make the leap before, so now it's my time. I acquired the knowledge I lacked in an intensive bootcamp, and now I consider myself a programmer, a Junior Front-End.

- 😄 I am 45 years old, I do not hide it, valuable years that have given me a more mature personal and professional perspective. Although it may seem otherwise, I believe that this is my strong point. My goal is to work as a web developer and keep learning. It is very satisfying to develop clean and working code, to see a website is well laid out, to solve bugs and offer the user a navigation experience of 10.

- 🌱 I consider myself a calm, outgoing, organized and committed person. I know how to prioritize tasks, I have initiative and I also know what is effort, work by objectives and manage hard work. I like to work in a team although I am perfectly autonomous if I am given tasks, I know how to "find my own way". People say that I have the ability to connect people with each other and make them feel comfortable working.

- 🌻 My hobbies include live music, reading, being with my family and playing sports. The latter has helped me for many years to be disciplined and to give my best, because you can always give a little more even if it seems that you can't do anything else.
