# Hi, I'm Noelia! 👋


## 🚀 About Me

I'm a junior front-end developer. I have always been curious about technology, so I decided to go for a professional change. I spent some time training in programming by myself and for family reasons I could not make the leap before, so now it's my time. I acquired the knowledge I didn´t have in an intensive bootcamp, and now I consider myself a programmer, a Junior Front-End.


## Other things about me

Professionally I have been dedicated to customer service since 2006. Throughout my professional career I have been in contact with many customers and I have learned to understand their needs and provide them with solutions. I have also been fortunate to work in a team with many people and learn from everyone.

👩‍💻 I´m currently working in my own portfolio y and I collaborate with the international platform Utest, doing manual QA work for websites and apps.

👯‍♀️ I would like to work with any company that gives me the opportunity to grow. My goal is to work as a web developer and keep learning.

💬 Ask me about anything you want, I will be happy to answer you. If I can help you in any way, please contact me.

⚡️ Fun fact...
I am 46 years old, valuable years that have given me a more mature personal and professional perspective. Although it may seem otherwise, I believe that this is my strong point.
